## Features

Basically, this little app only allows you to do one thing :

* Show the weather of your place

... with some extras :

* change temperature unit when clicking on it (Fahrenheit/Celsius)
* displays an image corresponding to your city's weather

---

## What exactly does it do ?

It asks for the permission to get the location of the user, when the user allows the app to get that : the app calls the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> with the user's location and get in return the temperature of the place, and an image which the app displays for the user to have an additional preview of what the temperature looks like where he is.
